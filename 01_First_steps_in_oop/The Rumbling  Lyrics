Rumbling, Rumbling, it's coming!
Rumbling, Rumbling!
Beware!
Coming for you!
All I ever wanted to do was do right things
I never wanted to be the king, I swear
All I ever wanted to do was save your life
I never wanted to grab a knife, I swear
I'm tearless, I'm fearless
I'm burning, I'm burning
You tell me what have I missed?
Still wandering in the deep mist
If I lose it all, slip and fall
I will never look away
If I lose it all, lose it all, lose it all
If I lose it all outside the wall
Live to die another day
I don't want anything, I'm just here to...
Beware!
All I ever wanted to do was know what's out there?
I refused to lose without a fight, oh, oh-yeah
Oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh
We're just too young, ignorant and innocent
Like kids stay up all night in a tent, oh yeah
How do you see me? Oh yeah
Am I who I used to be?
Beware!
Nobody knows what's inside of me
Nobody knows what's inside of me
Nobody knows what's inside of me
Ah
If I lose it all, slip and fall
Will you laugh at me?
If I lose it all, lose it all
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
If I lose it all, slip and fall
I will never look away
If I lose it all, lose it all, lose it all
If I lose it all outside the wall
Live to die another day
I don't want anything, I'm just here to...
Beware!
Rumbling, Rumbling, it's coming!
Rumbling, Rumbling!
Coming for you!
Rumbling, Rumbling, it's coming!
Rumbling, Rumbling!
